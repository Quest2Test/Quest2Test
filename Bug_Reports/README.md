# 🐛 Bug Reports

This folder contains **sample bug reports** written in a studio-style format: clear titles, repro steps, expected vs actual results, severity, priority, and environment details.  
The goal is to show how I **communicate issues** so developers and producers can quickly understand impact and reproduce problems.

## 📁 Structure

Each bug (or group of bugs) is stored in its own subfolder or file:

Bug-Reports/
├── Software_Name1/
│   ├── B001_Issue.md
│   ├── B002_Issue.md
│   └── screenshots/
├── Software_Name2/
│   ├── B010_Issue.md
│   └── screenshots/
└── README.md
