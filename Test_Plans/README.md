# 🧭 Test Plans

High-level **test plans** that describe strategy, scope, risks, and approach for different products and releases.  
This folder shows how I organise and communicate testing work, similar to how studios use TestRail, Jira and internal docs.
<!--
## 📁 File Index

- **[Test_plan_example.md](Test_plan_example.md)**  
  Full example of a structured manual test plan (scope, risks, approach, entry/exit criteria, deliverables).

- **[Regression_Test_Plan.md](Regression_Test_Plan.md)**  
  Focused regression strategy describing what is / isn’t covered, priorities, and cycles for new releases.

- **[TestRail_Flows.md](TestRail_Flows.md)**  
  Notes and simple workflow diagram on how I structure suites, sections and runs in TestRail-like tools.

- **[Jira_workflows.md](Jira_workflows.md)**  
  QA ticket lifecycle description (statuses, transitions, priorities) inspired by typical Jira boards.

## 🔍 How to Read These Plans

- Start with `Test_plan_example.md` to see my general template.  
- Use `Regression_Test_Plan.md` to understand how I adapt the template for regressions only.  
- Check `TestRail_Flows.md` and `Jira_workflows.md` to see how I connect documentation to real tools and workflows.
